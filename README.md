-----------------------------------------

## Further Operation

Once set up, the AI/tool will operate until stopped. This can be done by either stopping the application with a keyboard command (Ctrl-C) or by exiting the application. (Command provides the safest shutdown)

The AI/tool can be run in multiple instances under the same executable, provided there is only one instance per exchange.

Should there be a need for multiple instances on the same exchange, there need to be unique installations of the AI/tool.

**IMPORTANT**

_When adding money to a portfolio that has already been configured, ensure that you "reconfigure" your algorithm._

**If you do not, the built in profit tracking will not be able to detect the new deposit and will instead think that it is profit generated by the algorithm, resulting in unnecessary donations. Reconfiguring ensures that a new baseline is established.**

Any issues or inquiries can be directed to support@nescience.io

## Build

To ensure that the most recent release is genuine, check that the PGP-signature in "Signature.txt.gpg" is that of Nescience Software & Capital. Our fingerprint will always be available on our website's home page.

Further, the best way to validate a new release is to build/compile the application yourself based on the Python scripts provided in the "Scripts" folder, while inspecting any new changes. This requires Python 3.5+ and a number of dependencies, and can be done following the steps below:

  1. If you do not already have Python 3.5+ install an appropriate version as can be found here. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
  2. Open a command prompt and using these commands, download and install pip (pythons package installation tool).
  
    
    
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    
    python get-pip.py
    
    
  3. Ensure each dependency listed in "Dependencies.txt" are installed using pip.
  
    
    
    pip install 'package==version"
    
    
    
  4. For each exchange you would like to use, in your "Scripts" folder generate an additional folder with the name of the exchange.
     (Coinbase= "GDAX", Binance = "Binance", Kucoin= "Kucoin", Kraken= "Kraken", etc.)
     
  5. In each folder, create 3 JSON files with the following titles and the following content:
  
----------------------  
  
1. Title: "Config"

    Content:   
    ```
    {"configcheck": ""}
    ```
2. Title: "Initial"

    Content:
    ```
    {"initialcheck": ""}
    ```
    
3. Title: "Performance"
    
    Content:
    ```
    {"initialcheck2": ""}
    ```

----------------------  

__At this point, the scripts will function if called using Python, run "Nescience_rebalance.py" and chose your exchange!__
    
    
__If you would like a complete executable follow the one of the guides below__
    
  The steps to do so are different depending on system specifics and the packaging tool chosen. 
  
  Pyinstaller : https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
  
  CxFreeze : https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  
  Py2Exe : https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/chapter40_py2exe.html
  
   __NOTE:__
   
   Using the packaging tool of your choice, target the MAIN script, "Nescience_Rebalance" as the script to be compiled.
  
   If the tool chosen does not recursively search for modules, ensure each script in the "Scripts" folder is included. 

   If the folders you created are not included, ensure that they are located in the same folder as your Nescience_Rebalance python  script or executable. 

   If using Pyinstaller, we have found that strptime.py is commonly not imported, if you run into this issue simply add strptime.py to the data field of the spec file.
